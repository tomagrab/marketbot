### The MarketBot Experiment

Hello and welcome!

This repository is home to **MarketBot**, a web application designed to simulate a stock market where users can observe or compete with an AI-powered "Investor Bot." But this app isnâ€™t just about gameplay or learning investment strategiesâ€”it's the centerpiece of an experiment.

As a software engineer, I wanted to see how effective **[o1 Pro Mode](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-pro/)**, OpenAI's most powerful coding assistant, could be when used as a true coding companion in a practical project. MarketBot serves as a testbed for this exploration.

### What Is the Experiment About?

The goal of this experiment is simple: to evaluate how well o1 Pro Mode performs in real-world software development. This means seeing how it handles tasks like:

- Refining backend database models.
- Offering useful code suggestions.
- Helping to troubleshoot complex development challenges.

Rather than focusing on teaching o1 Pro Mode to code from scratch, the experiment starts with a pre-scaffolded project. The app is built incrementally, with feedback from o1 Pro Mode shaping the development process step by step.

### Why MarketBot?

MarketBot is more than just an interesting app concept; itâ€™s a practical scenario that requires a mix of database design, algorithmic thinking, and frontend/backend integration. This makes it the perfect environment to test o1 Pro Mode's capabilities.

The app challenges o1 Pro Mode to:

- Work on a backend-first development process, where data modeling is the initial focus.
- Suggest optimizations to improve the overall structure and efficiency of the app.
- Assist in making decisions on how to approach problems during the appâ€™s development lifecycle.

### In Closing

MarketBot is both an application and a journey. This repository doesnâ€™t just showcase codeâ€”it documents the collaborative effort between a developer and a cutting-edge AI coding tool.

If youâ€™re here out of curiosity about MarketBot or how AI like o1 Pro Mode can shape software development, we hope this project offers insights and sparks discussions about the future of AI-assisted programming.

Thank you for visiting, and enjoy exploring the experiment!
