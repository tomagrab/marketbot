### MarketBot: A Unique Stock Market Simulation

Hello!

I'm excited to introduce my latest project, MarketBot, a web app designed to simulate a stock market where users can interact with an AI-powered "Investor Bot." MarketBot combines interactive gameplay with cutting-edge AI to create a dynamic and educational experience for users. Here's an overview of the project and how I plan to collaborate with OpenAI's o1 Pro Mode to bring it to life:

---

### Project Overview

MarketBot is a simulated stock market platform where users can:

1. Observe or compete against an AI-powered Investor Bot.
2. Learn investment strategies through dynamic gameplay.
3. Customize their experience by adjusting game parameters such as initial funds and game duration.

The Investor Bot, driven by the OpenAI API, will analyze simulated market trends and make strategic investment decisions. This app will highlight the power of o1 Pro Mode in coding, AI integration, and backend-first development.

### Features and Functionality

**Game Context**

- **Simulated Stock Market**: A virtual market with fictional companies, stock values, and trends that evolve dynamically based on predefined or randomized algorithms.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Users can set initial investment funds and choose the game duration (e.g., one month, one year, five years).
- **Game Modes**:
  - **Automated Mode**: Watch the Investor Bot make decisions independently, offering an observational learning experience.
  - **Beat the Bot Mode**: Compete with the bot, trying to outperform its investments. The player or bot with the highest portfolio value at the end of the game wins.

**Investor Bot Features**

- **AI-Powered Decisions**: The bot uses the OpenAI API to analyze simulated market data, including company stock values, historical trends, and "news" events, to make informed buy/sell decisions.

- **Dynamic Interactions**: The bot reacts to market changes during gameplay, simulating realistic trading behavior.

---

### Development Approach

- **Backend/Data-First Focus**: MarketBot is built with a backend-first philosophy. Our priority will be defining the database schema and creating efficient, scalable models before moving on to frontend development or additional integrations.
- **Pre-Scaffolded Project**: The base project is already set up with the required tech stack. No need to scaffold or install basic dependencies initially. As new requirements emerge, dependencies will be installed when necessary.

---

### Tech Stack

1. **Frontend**:

   - **Next.js (App Router)** with TypeScript for a modern, performant frontend framework.
   - **shadcn/ui** for reusable, elegant components styled with TailwindCSS.

2. **Backend**:

   - **Prisma ORM** for database modeling and interaction.
   - **PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)** for a robust and scalable relational database.

3. **AI Integration**:
   - **OpenAI API** to power the Investor Bot‚Äôs decision-making.

---

### Goals

1. Leverage o1 Pro Mode‚Äôs Capabilities:

   - Collaborate with o1 Pro Mode to refine backend models, optimize algorithms, and build a clean, efficient codebase.

2. Create a Unique User Experience:

   - Combine education and entertainment in a simulated market environment.

3. Focus on Scalability and Maintainability:
   - Develop with best practices to ensure a future-proof application.

### Database Models

Below is the initial `schema.prisma` file for our project. This will serve as the starting point for database modeling. I‚Äôd like o1 Pro Mode to analyze and suggest improvements or optimizations based on the app's goals:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Industry {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  companies Company[]
  marketId  String
  market    Market    @relation(fields: [marketId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Company {
  id                      String      @id @default(uuid())
  name                    String
  industryId              String
  industry                Industry    @relation(fields: [industryId], references: [id])
  stockSymbolId           String
  stockSymbol             StockSymbol @relation(fields: [stockSymbolId], references: [id])
  marketId                String
  market                  Market      @relation(fields: [marketId], references: [id])
  stockPriceHigh          Float
  stockPriceLow           Float
  stockPriceCurrent       Float
  stockPriceOpen          Float
  stockPriceClose         Float
  stockPriceChange        Float
  stockPriceChangePercent Float
  createdAt               DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt               DateTime    @updatedAt
}

model StockSymbol {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  company   Company[]
  symbol    String
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Market {
  id         String     @id @default(uuid())
  name       String
  companies  Company[]
  industries Industry[]
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
}
```
