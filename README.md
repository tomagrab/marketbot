### MarketBot: A Simulated Stock Market Experiment

> üõë **Transparency Notice** | This README was co-written with ChatGPT 4o. Please exercise caution while reading and interpreting.

> üóíÔ∏è **Document Notes** | I basically shotgunned a bunch of information and a couple of Markdown files at ChatGPT 4o and was like "Aye yo fam, spin me up a README" as a sort of starting point for an informative README.

### Overview

Welcome to **MarketBot**, a unique web application designed to simulate a stock market where users can interact with an AI-powered "Investor Bot." This project serves a dual purpose:

1. **As an application**, it offers users an engaging and educational experience through gameplay that mimics real-world stock market dynamics.
2. **As an experiment**, it tests the effectiveness of OpenAI‚Äôs o1 Pro Mode as a coding companion in a practical software development scenario.

---

### About the Experiment

The MarketBot project is a testbed to evaluate how well o1 Pro Mode assists in real-world software engineering tasks. The experiment aims to assess its capabilities in:

- Refining backend database models.
- Generating useful code and architectural suggestions.
- Assisting in troubleshooting and problem-solving during development.

Unlike traditional development projects, MarketBot starts with a pre-scaffolded project. This allows the focus to remain on incremental development and leveraging o1 Pro Mode for high-value tasks, such as optimizing algorithms, refining data models, and integrating advanced AI functionality.

---

### Core Features

#### Gameplay

MarketBot provides an interactive, simulated stock market experience with the following features:

- **Simulated Stock Market**: A virtual environment with fictional companies, dynamic stock values, and trends that evolve based on pre-defined or randomized algorithms.
- **Customizable Gameplay**: Users can configure initial funds, set the game duration (e.g., one month, one year, five years), and select game modes.
- **Game Modes**:
  - **Automated Mode**: The AI Investor Bot plays independently, showcasing its decision-making capabilities.
  - **Beat the Bot Mode**: Users compete against the bot, with the highest portfolio value at the end of the game determining the winner.

#### Investor Bot

The AI-powered Investor Bot is the heart of MarketBot.

- **AI-Driven Decision-Making**: The bot uses the OpenAI API to analyze simulated market data, including company stock values, historical trends, and fictional news, to make informed buy/sell decisions.
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: It reacts to market changes during gameplay, simulating realistic trading behaviors.

---

### Development Approach

MarketBot is built with a backend-first philosophy, prioritizing robust and scalable database modeling as the foundation for development.

- **Database Models**: Initial database schema has been defined in schema.prisma. o1 Pro Mode is tasked with analyzing and refining these models to align with the project goals.
- **Incremental Development**: The project evolves iteratively, with o1 Pro Mode providing code suggestions and optimizations as the app's functionality expands.
- **Pre-Scaffolded Base**: The core project setup (e.g., dependencies, scaffolding) is already in place, enabling the focus to remain on advanced tasks.

---

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend

- **Next.js (App Router)** with TypeScript: A modern, performant framework for the frontend, providing type safety and a clean developer experience.
- **shadcn/ui**: A design system built with TailwindCSS and Radix UI for elegant, reusable components.

#### Backend

- **Vercel**: A cloud platform for deploying Next.js applications, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Prisma ORM**: A robust Object-Relational Mapping tool for seamless database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL (hosted on Neon)**: A scalable and reliable cloud database for managing user data, game states, and market simulations.

#### AI Integration

- **OpenAI API**: Powering the Investor Bot‚Äôs decision-making, leveraging ChatGPT to analyze market conditions and execute trades intelligently.

### Initial Database Schema

Below are the initial Prisma models I created (with co-pilot autocomplete and minor syntax fixes) specifically for the MarketBot proposal. The initial schema would never be used in Production; it was intended to be inspiration for o1:

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model Industry {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  name      String
  companies Company[]
  marketId  String
  market    Market    @relation(fields: [marketId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Company {
  id                      String      @id @default(uuid())
  name                    String
  industryId              String
  industry                Industry    @relation(fields: [industryId], references: [id])
  stockSymbolId           String
  stockSymbol             StockSymbol @relation(fields: [stockSymbolId], references: [id])
  marketId                String
  market                  Market      @relation(fields: [marketId], references: [id])
  stockPriceHigh          Float
  stockPriceLow           Float
  stockPriceCurrent       Float
  stockPriceOpen          Float
  stockPriceClose         Float
  stockPriceChange        Float
  stockPriceChangePercent Float
  createdAt               DateTime    @default(now())
  updatedAt               DateTime    @updatedAt
}

model StockSymbol {
  id        String    @id @default(uuid())
  company   Company[]
  symbol    String
  createdAt DateTime  @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime  @updatedAt
}

model Market {
  id         String     @id @default(uuid())
  name       String
  companies  Company[]
  industries Industry[]
  createdAt  DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime   @updatedAt
}
```

This schema provides the foundation for MarketBot‚Äôs backend, capturing relationships between industries, companies, stock symbols, and markets. Future iterations will refine this schema to better support app functionality.
